## About Project :

In this project I have build my own arcade game. My game should look as shown on this video:

## Basic Functionality :

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## How to play :

Open index.html in your latest browser(Google Chrome) from the my project folder.

For moving Player use following keys -

* Arrow key 'up' - To move forward.
* Arrow key 'down' - To move backward.
* Arrow key 'left' - To move lef
* Arrow key 'right' - To move right.
* To restart game press 'spacebar'.

##  Minimum requirement to run this game.

* Latest Browser with javascript enabled
* Windows 7/8/10 or Mac Os.
